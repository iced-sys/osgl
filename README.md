- **Beginner Friendly**  
  We've kept things super easy for you - an API that was designed with simplicity in mind - even if you're just starting out.

- **Drawing go brrrrrrrr**  
  Built from the ground to handle whatever you throw at it with no problems.

- **Thread-safe**  
  Plays *so* nice with threads you'd think they were childhood friends. Trust me. 

- **It... just works!?**  
  Drop it into any Roblox project and it just works. No weird dependencies or special setup needed.
